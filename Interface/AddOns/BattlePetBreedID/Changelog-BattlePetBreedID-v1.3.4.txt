[b4ee9152fbdc] [v1.3.4]
* BattlePetBreedID.lua:

Added calculation support for a new aspect of WoD Pet Battles - Wild pets now have a 25% reduced Power stat.
Additionally, adjusted calculation weights when determining breed so that HP differences are now valued equally with Power and Speed differences (instead of being worth 5x as much).
